Someone could use the webpage to see if their are any UFO sightings near them. 
## Summary:
 
One drawback of the webpage is that the data will not update over time. One way the webpage could be improved would be allowing users to report sightings on the webpage. Another way to improve the project would be to allow the data to update on its own by automated webscraping or pulling from and API.
